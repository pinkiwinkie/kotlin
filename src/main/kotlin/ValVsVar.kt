    //6. VAL is used to declare read-only variables, that is, not mutable
    // If we want to define mutable variables we must use VAR
    //7. When should we use val or var?
        // Actually, we can always use var and there would be no problems in the project,
        // but the reality is that programming is a work that is done as a team and
        // val serves to give semantics to the code that is written.
        // Being able to know at a glance whether a variable will mutate or not throughout the code
        // it is very useful for the rest of the team working on the same project.
